# HealthCare_Analysis
The dataset is referred from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset
In this project, I worked on a healthcare dataset to explore and understand patient and hospital-related data. I started by cleaning the data and organizing it into separate tables like patients, visits, and doctors to make it easier to analyze.
Using both SQL and Python, I was able to answer important questions like:
Which gender and blood type are most common among admitted patients.
What are the most frequent medical conditions and which medications are used to treat them.
Which doctors see the most patients, and who is the top doctor for each condition.
What is the average hospital stay for each condition.
Which insurance providers are most preferred by patients.
One interesting part was identifying the most used medication and automatically analyzing what conditions it's used to treat â€” which I visualized using pie charts.
Overall, this project helped me practice real-world data analysis skills like cleaning messy data, writing SQL queries, working with relational databases, and creating clear visualizations. It also showed how data can help answer practical healthcare questions.
